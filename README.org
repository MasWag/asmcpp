asm.c++ is a simple monitor generator for C++ programs. Given a configuration of the monitored functions, asm.c++ automatically inject the monitoring function using [[https://www.aspectc.org/][Aspect C++]].

** Requirements

asm.c++ is based on Aspect C++. In Ubuntu, Aspect C++ can be installed by the following command. For the other environments, binary distribution of Aspect C++ is found at the [[https://www.aspectc.org/][official web page]].

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
apt install make aspectc++ -y
#+END_SRC

** Usage

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Usage: asmc++ [MONITORED_FILE] -c [CONF_FILE] -o [OUTPUT_FILE]
Example: asmc++ sample.cc -c sample.conf -o sample_monitored.cc
#+END_EXAMPLE
